                    <h2>Websites</h2>
                    <p>There is a couple of websites that I've created and hand coded with HTML and CSS coding languages. First one is about a Billiards bar that would be located in Palatine, IL called <a href=" http://robertmodulelabs.altervista.org/publish/index.html">Hustlin Billiards</a> and the second one is about a camping resort that would be located at California called <a href="http://robertmodulelabs.altervista.org/Mod11/index.html">Pacific Trails Resort.</a> I've learned these new skills in a web development class at Harper College.</p>

                    <img src="graphic%20designs/Screen%20Shot%202017-10-16%20at%2010.47.54%20AM.png" width="310" height="180">

                    <br>
                    <p>The third website that I've created used multiple types of front-end languages like: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Angular JS, JQuery, Bootstrap and Web API's to make the website interactive and visually appealing. The back-end languages that I've used include: ASP.Net MVC 5, ASP.Net  Express, ASP.Net Razor, and Microsoft SQL Server to make my information more organized, securable, and functional. I've learned to utilized these coding languages from Coding Temple to make a functional E-commerce business. The name of this E-commerce website is BeerPack because it mainly sells craft beer to consumers.</p>
                    <h2>Blog</h2>
                    <p>This was a project for my Introduction to Integrated Marketing Communications class in creating a <a href="http://epiccocktails.blogspot.com">blog</a> about simple cocktail recipes targeting towards young college students. They can make simple cocktail <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1V23XDTrEJyF7S1xjHmlrxZYZsSeBJxH8vQijRUtDSZ8/edit#slide=id.p4">drinks</a> that don't require a lot of ingredients and $$ that tastes great. The project was also involved using google analytics to track the amount of users that visited the blog from different locations, software, browsers, etc... </p>
                    <h2>App</h2>
                    <p>This is an <a href="http://h.fanapp.mobi/capcustomizer">app</a> that I created in my free time on helping New ERA cap and LIDS promote their product in the app market by leting customers customize their own cap on the app that can directly go to the company's main website and from there you can create your own cap in no time. </p>
