        <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
        <p>I am a motivated, driven, and a tech-savvy college graduate who aspires to work in the marketing, advertising, or in the technology industry. To enhance my knowledge in this field, I have taken in depth course work and have pursued opportunities to gain the necessary field experiences. I was the director of programs for the Sports Marketing Student Association. This organization helps promote sports teams within ISU athletics and gains information and knowledge from surrounding professional sports teams. This role has afforded me the opportunity to lead other students in the organization. I am looking for a position as a marketing/advertising associate that is sustainable for years to come. I believe that I have the knowledge, determination, work ethic, and sense of creativity to market other businesses.</p>
